1.基本概念描述

// A Table is a sorted map from strings to strings.  Tables are
// immutable and persistent.  A Table may be safely accessed from
// multiple threads without external synchronization.

  // Attempt to open the table that is stored in bytes [0..file_size)
  // of "file", and read the metadata entries necessary to allow
  // retrieving data from the table.
  //            
  // If successful, returns ok and sets "*table" to the newly opened
  // table.  The client should delete "*table" when no longer needed.
  // If there was an error while initializing the table, sets "*table"
  // to nullptr and returns a non-ok status.  Does not take ownership of
  // "*source", but the client must ensure that "source" remains live
  // for the duration of the returned table's lifetime.
  //            
  // *file must remain live while this Table is in use.
